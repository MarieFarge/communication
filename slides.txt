# The main idea 

- This is institution centered : to help the institutions and their researchers to elaborate an open access policy.
- Input: 
	* list of departments
	* list of researchers 
- Output:
	* list of annotated publications : availability, publishing policy ... 

# Harvesting: the sources
- Primary (specific APIs):
	* CrossRef.org 
	* Bielefeld Academic Search 
	* SHERPA/RoMEO 
	* Cores

- And from some repositories via OAI-PMH : 
	* arXiv
	* HAL
	* PubMed Central
	* DOAJ, Pers√©e, Cairn.info, Numdam, ... 

# Updating the harvest

- OAI-PMH is like RSS feeds (or Atom)
- We can so just keep track of new entries.

# Disambiguation 

- We can get the same paper several times : we need to say that it is the same paper.
- We need to identify authors.
- TODO classifier

# A human feedback for disambiguation

- We added a way for authenticated users to give feedback on authorship of articles.
- to correct wrong classifications by hand will improve the full classification. 


# Uploading full text: to improve the picture.

- If I am a researcher, to put my paper on repositories I usually need :
	+ the metadatas
	+ the consentment of the authors and publishers
	+ hopefully the fulltext / the tex file / the document.
  
- In dissemin, we already know the publisher policy and we have the metadatas.
So we only need the consentment of the authors and the plain document. 


# Protocol. 

- SWORD: Basic HTTP, widely used.
- This protocol is used by HAL (Big french repository).
- This is widely used,
- But all the difficulty is in the details, and in the range of usecases!
- There are alternatives that we should also support (zenodo for example).

# Email  

- A feature to ask the authors for a fulltext.
- Possible :
	+ if you are authenticated
	+ if the authors did not get an email the last 15 days.
	+ if the policy of the publisher allows that 

# CAS authentication

- Central Authentication System (CAS) are widely deployed in universities.   
- Dissemin creates an authenticated account for all the researchers.
- No possiblity to create fake accounts.


# Future works and ideas

- possibility for an user to add an entry not found by dissemin.
- research function
- an output API
- a docker version (it exists a VM version)
- more API (for Zenodo for example)
- a strong SWORD implementation
- a meta-dissemin?

And more important 

- to test the system in real production: hopefully in october 2015 at the ENS.
