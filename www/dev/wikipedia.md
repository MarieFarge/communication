OABOT
=====

The OABOT project has been set up to create a
Wikipedia bot that adds links to open repositories on references to academic papers.
[The official discussion and coordination page is on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_Wikipedia_Library/OABOT).

A [Wikipedia bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Bots) is a software that performs automatic edits of Wikipedia pages.

Proposed pipeline
-----------------

 * Extract references from Wikipedia pages
 * Use [the dissemin API](api.html) to fetch a link to a free source for that paper
 * Add this link to the Wikipedia reference
