Dissemin API
============

Dissemin provides an API to query the availability of arbitrary papers.
Please do not assume the interface will not change in the future as it
is still being improved.

The endpoint of the api is [http://dissem.in/api/query](http://dissem.in/api/query)
and expects this data as a JSON payload sent using the POST method.

Querying by DOI
---------------

Papers can be queried by their DOIs, when they have one.
This is the preferred method as it tends to return richer results.

```curl -d '{"doi":"10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.013"}' http://dissem.in/api/query```

For convenience, looking up a paper by DOI can also be done with a GET request:
[http://dissem.in/api/10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.013](http://dissem.in/api/10.1016/j.paid.2009.02.013).

Querying by metadata
--------------------

If no DOI is available, one can use the title, authors and publication date to
retrive the paper.

```
curl -d '{"title":"Strange resonances measured in Al+Al collisions at sqrt {S_ NN }= 2.65 GeV with the FOPI detector","date":"2015","authors":[{"plain":"Lopez, X."}]}' http://beta.dissem.in/api/query
```

Note that this is not a search API: if the input is well-formed, 
it will return exactly one result, with the metadata provided, and possibly
some links to sources where the content (or just the metadata) can be found.


Understanding the results
-------------------------

        "abstract": "Proactive coping, directed at an upcoming as opposed to an ongoing stressor, is a new focus in positive psychology research. However, two differing conceptualizations of this construct create confusion. This study compared how each operationalization of proactive coping relates to well-being. Participants (N = 281) facing an upcoming college examination completed the Proactive Coping Inventory (PCI; consisting of two subscales that each assess one of the conceptualizations), the Proactive Competence Scale (PCS; that assesses the proactive coping process), and measures of well-being. The results demonstrated that conceptualizing proactive coping as a positively-focused striving for goals was predictive of well-being (the shared variance from affect, subjective well-being and physical symptoms), whereas conceptualizing proactive coping as focused on preventing a negative future was not. The first conceptualization of proactive copingâ€™s unique association with well-being was explained by two of the proactive competencies, use of resources and realistic goal setting, and the remaining variance in well-being was explained by the first factor of optimism. These results demonstrated that aspiring for a positive future is distinctly predictive of well-being and that research should focus on accumulating resources and goal setting in designing interventions to promote proactive coping.",

Most fields are self-explanatory, here is a quick description of the other ones:

 * ***classification*** is the code for the category of the paper: "OA" (available from the publisher), "OK" (available from the author), "COULDBE" (unavailable but could be shared), "UNK" (unavailable; unknown/unclear sharing policy), "CLOSED" (unavailable, restrictive sharing policy).
 * ***pdf\_url*** is the URL where dissemin thinks the full text can be accessed for free. This is rarely a direct link to an actual PDF file. It is set to `null` if we could not find a free source for this paper.
 * ***publications*** gives a list of the places where this paper has been published (so: journals, conferences), and the associated bibliographical metadata. If the publisher has been found in RoMEO, it also indicates the summary of its policy, using the codes drawn from [the RoMEO API](http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/api.html). This list will remain empty if no DOI is provided.
 * ***records*** gives a list of the places where the full text has been made available (so: repositories, homepages or social networks). Sometimes, these repositories only contain a bibliographical record and not the full text. The ***pdf_url*** field of each record indicates our assessment of the availability of that record.

License, usage
--------------

CAPSH claims no ownership of the metadata served via this API. It has been collected from various free sources.

The interface itself should not be abused: please do not use concurrent connections on it, and keep your requests to a slow rate (at most one per second).
