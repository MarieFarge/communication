	Grammars are presented and a new parsing strategy is proposed. Then,
	theoretical learnability and non-learnability results for subclasses
	of Pregroup Grammars are proved. In the last two parts, we focus
	on learning Pregroup Grammars from a special kind of input called
	feature-tagged examples. A learning algorithm based on the parsing
	strategy presented in the first part is given. Its validity is proved
	and its properties are examplified},

	First, we introduce a generative model of sentences, based on dependency
	trees and which takes into account homonymy. Our model can thus be
	seen as a generalization of Brown clustering. Second, we describe
	an efficient algorithm to perform inference and learning in this
	model. Third, we apply our proposed method on two large datasets
	($10^8$ tokens, $10^5$ words types), and demonstrate that classes
	induced by our algorithm improve performance over Brown clustering
	on the task of semi-supervised supersense tagging and named entity
	recognition.}},
