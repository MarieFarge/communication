    \block{Why are we using tensors after all?}{
        \Large {

The category theory behind the distributional compositional model gives useful properties:
for instance, the spurious ambiguity in CCG has no impact on the final semantic representation of a sentence.
In practice however, implementations often depart from the original framework, because using
only tensors and linear maps does not always give the best results.

We can get both the theoretical guarantees
of category theory and the flexibility of alternate models of meaning using
the notion of \emph{free compact closed category}. }

            The category of vector spaces with the cartesian product is not
            so it cannot be used as is for models of meaning,
            but has interesting properties.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $\dim A \times B = \dim A + \dim B$: low dimensionality, word
                 representations are easier to learn
            \item Morphisms can be any maps, in particular
                 non-linear ones
            \item No compact closure: type reductions cannot be represented as morphisms

            \item $\dim A \otimes B = \dim A \times \dim B$: high dimensionality, word
                 representations are harder to learn
            \item Morphisms have to be linear, not monoidal otherwise
